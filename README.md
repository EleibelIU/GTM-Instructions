## üìÇ Integration Options

### 1. **Generic Static Site**
For static sites that do not use any content management system, you‚Äôll need to manually insert the GTM code into your HTML files. This method provides the highest level of control but requires basic HTML editing knowledge.

### 2. **CMS Platform (e.g., Locally.com)**
If your website uses a content management system (CMS) like Locally.com, adding GTM usually involves using built-in tools or admin sections. This option is for users who may not have direct access to the underlying code.

### 3. **WordPress Site**
For WordPress users, adding GTM can be done in two ways: manually by editing theme files or automatically using one of several available plugins. WordPress offers flexibility in how GTM is integrated, making it a popular choice for marketers and developers alike.

## What‚Äôs the Difference Between These Options?

- **Generic Static Site**: This method involves manual code insertion into your site‚Äôs HTML files, providing full control but requiring basic coding knowledge.
- **CMS (Locally.com)**: Many CMS platforms restrict direct code access. Instead, GTM is added using platform-specific tools.
- **WordPress**: WordPress allows flexibility with both manual and plugin-based approaches to GTM integration.

## üîç How to Determine Your Site Type

Before proceeding, it‚Äôs essential to know what kind of site you're working with. Here‚Äôs how you can determine whether your site is a generic static site, a CMS, or WordPress.

### 1. **Generic Static Site**
A generic static site typically consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files without dynamic content from a database or CMS. If your site doesn‚Äôt have a login panel or admin area, it‚Äôs likely a static site.
- **Characteristics**: Purely HTML files, no database, minimal interactivity.
- **Tools to Verify**: 
  - You can inspect the site‚Äôs source code by right-clicking on the page and selecting **View Page Source**. Look for simple HTML tags and no references to platforms or CMS.
  - Tools like [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/) or [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/) can also confirm if no CMS is detected.

### 2. **CMS Platform (e.g., Locally.com)**
A CMS-based website allows you to create and manage content without direct access to the site‚Äôs code. If your website has a backend login interface (e.g., `/admin` or `/dashboard` URL), it's likely powered by a CMS.
- **Characteristics**: Backend access via a URL like `/admin`, `/dashboard`, or `/login`. Dynamic content managed through an interface.
- **Tools to Verify**:
  - Use tools like [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/) or [WhatCMS](https://whatcms.org/) to detect the CMS your site is using.

### 3. **WordPress Site**
WordPress-powered sites are identifiable through their URL structure (e.g., `/wp-admin` for backend access) and file paths (e.g., `/wp-content` for media uploads).
- **Characteristics**: `/wp-admin` for login, `/wp-content` for assets, and typical WordPress plugins or themes.
- **Tools to Verify**: 
  - Use [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/) or [IsItWP](https://www.isitwp.com/) to detect if a site is using WordPress.
