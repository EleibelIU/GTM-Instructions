## Determining Your Site Type

Before proceeding, it‚Äôs essential to know what kind of site you're working with. Here‚Äôs how you can determine whether your site is a generic static site, a CMS, or WordPress.

### **Generic Static Site**
A generic static site typically consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files without dynamic content from a database or CMS. If your site doesn‚Äôt have a login panel or admin area, it‚Äôs likely a static site.
- **Characteristics**: Purely HTML files, no database, minimal interactivity.
- **Tools to Verify**: 
  - You can inspect the site‚Äôs source code by right-clicking on the page and selecting **View Page Source**. Look for simple HTML tags and no references to platforms or CMS.
  - Tools like [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/) or [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/) can also confirm if no CMS is detected.

### **CMS Platform (e.g., Locally.com)**
A CMS-based website allows you to create and manage content without direct access to the site‚Äôs code. If your website has a backend login interface (e.g., `/admin` or `/dashboard` URL), it's likely powered by a CMS.
- **Characteristics**: Backend access via a URL like `/admin`, `/dashboard`, or `/login`. Dynamic content managed through an interface.
- **Tools to Verify**:
  - Use tools like [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/) or [WhatCMS](https://whatcms.org/) to detect the CMS your site is using.

### **WordPress Site**
WordPress-powered sites are identifiable through their URL structure (e.g., `/wp-admin` for backend access) and file paths (e.g., `/wp-content` for media uploads).
- **Characteristics**: `/wp-admin` for login, `/wp-content` for assets, and typical WordPress plugins or themes.
- **Tools to Verify**: 
  - Use [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/) or [IsItWP](https://www.isitwp.com/) to detect if a site is using WordPress.
