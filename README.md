## 📂 Integration Options

### 1. **Generic Static Site**
For static sites that do not use any content management system, you’ll need to manually insert the GTM code into your HTML files. This method provides the highest level of control but requires basic HTML editing knowledge.

### 2. **CMS Platform (e.g., Locally.com)**
If your website uses a content management system (CMS) like Locally.com, adding GTM usually involves using built-in tools or admin sections. This option is for users who may not have direct access to the underlying code.

- **WordPress**: WordPress allows flexibility with both manual and plugin-based approaches to GTM integration.
