Welcome to the **Google Tag Manager (GTM) Integration Instructions Repository**! This repository contains comprehensive guides for adding GTM tags to the most commonly encountered integration options. 

Each guide is tailored to the specific platform to ensure easy integration and proper implementation. Follow the instructions that best suit your site's platform.

## Integration Options

| Site Type | Description | View Guide |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Generic Static Site | Basic HTML/CSS/JS websites without a CMS | [View Guide](Generic.md) |
| CMS (e.g., Locally.com) | Websites using content management systems | [View Guide](CMS.md) |
| WordPress | Websites built on WordPress platform | [View Guide](Wp.md) |


## Testing Your GTM Integration

Once you've added GTM to your site, it's important to verify that the tag is firing correctly. Testing can be done using Google's Preview mode or the Google Tag Assistant Chrome extension.

## Determining Your Site Type

Before proceeding, it‚Äôs essential to know what kind of site you're working with. Here‚Äôs how you can determine whether your site is a generic static site, a CMS, or WordPress.

### **Generic Static Site**
A generic static site typically consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files without dynamic content from a database or CMS. If your site doesn‚Äôt have a login panel or admin area, it‚Äôs likely a static site.
- **Characteristics**: Purely HTML files, no database, minimal interactivity.
- **Tools to Verify**: 
  - You can inspect the site‚Äôs source code by right-clicking on the page and selecting **View Page Source**. Look for simple HTML tags and no references to platforms or CMS.
  - Tools like [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/) or [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/) can also confirm if no CMS is detected.

### CMS Platform
A CMS-based website allows you to create and manage content without direct access to the site‚Äôs code. If your website has a backend login interface (e.g., `/admin` or `/dashboard` URL), it's likely powered by a CMS.
- **Characteristics**: Backend access via a URL like `/admin`, `/dashboard`, or `/login`. Dynamic content managed through an interface.
- **Tools to Verify**:
  - Use tools like [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/) or [WhatCMS](https://whatcms.org/) to detect the CMS your site is using.

### **WordPress Site**
WordPress-powered sites are identifiable through their URL structure (e.g., `/wp-admin` for backend access) and file paths (e.g., `/wp-content` for media uploads).
- **Characteristics**: `/wp-admin` for login, `/wp-content` for assets, and typical WordPress plugins or themes.
- **Tools to Verify**: 
  - Use [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/) or [IsItWP](https://www.isitwp.com/) to detect if a site is using WordPress.



## (NEW) Locally-Specific Case
A [script has been created to deal with Locally's specific case](locally.js). Locally uses a centralized header and footer structure, which applies uniformly across all store landing pages. However, Google Tag Manager (GTM) typically requires a unique GTM ID for each individual store, as each ID corresponds to separate tracking configurations in Google Tag Manager. This poses a challenge when a global header is enforced, as each store's page cannot have its own specific GTM ID hardcoded into the header.

### Solution
To overcome this limitation, this script is designed to dynamically insert the appropriate GTM ID based on the store location derived from the URL. It works by:
- Extracting the store's location from the URL (e.g., `warrensburg` from `https://stores.brownsshoefitcompany.com/warrensburg`).
- Mapping the extracted store location to its corresponding GTM ID (e.g., `GTM-NTXG257P` for Warrensburg).
- Modifying only the **ID** in the existing GTM script (which is already included in the global header), ensuring the correct tracking for each store location.

### How It Works
- The GTM script is placed statically in the global header, but with the GTM ID placeholder left empty.
- A secondary inline script dynamically fetches the appropriate GTM ID by mapping the store‚Äôs URL path.
- The script then updates the GTM script‚Äôs `src` attribute to include the correct GTM ID for the store, ensuring accurate tracking without the need for individual hardcoded IDs.

This solution allows Locally Landing Pages to maintain their global header structure while still applying unique tracking for each store, solving the problem of having to manage multiple GTM scripts or making individual page changes.

### How to Implement 
Instructions for implementing the script are [here](locally.md)
