3. **Enter Your Website URL**: In the popup, enter the URL of the page you want to debug and click **Connect**.

4. **Debug Mode Opens**: Your site will now open in a new tab with the **GTM Debug** panel displayed at the bottom of the page. This panel allows you to see all the tags that are firing and the data being sent with them.

5. **Interact with Your Site**:
   - As you navigate and interact with your site, the Debug panel will update in real time, showing which tags are firing and when.
   - Look for the name of your GTM tags to ensure they are firing at the expected times.

### Common Issues & How to Fix Them:
- **Tag Not Firing**: Ensure that your triggers are properly set. For example, if you have set a Page View trigger, ensure it is configured for all pages or the right pages.
- **Incorrect Data**: Check if variables like event data or page URL are being passed correctly through GTM. You may need to verify your data layer.

## 2. Using the Google Tag Assistant Chrome Extension

The **Google Tag Assistant** is a browser extension that helps to validate and troubleshoot the installation of GTM tags, Google Analytics, and other tracking codes.

### Steps to Use Google Tag Assistant

1. **Install Google Tag Assistant**: Download the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tag-assistant-by-google/keelfcnbbclobkapmhcpoejnmlhpjkmc).

2. **Activate the Extension**:
   - Once installed, click the Tag Assistant icon in your Chrome toolbar.
   - Click **Enable** to turn it on.

3. **Visit Your Website**:
   - Navigate to the website where you‚Äôve installed your GTM tag.
   - The Tag Assistant will show a report of all Google tags running on the site.

4. **Check the GTM Tag**:
   - Look for the **Google Tag Manager** entry. A green icon indicates that the tag is working properly.
   - If there are any issues, you‚Äôll see a warning or error icon with suggestions on how to fix the problem.

5. **Review the Results**:
   - After interacting with the site, the Tag Assistant will provide detailed reports on which tags fired and if there were any issues.

## 3. Using Google Analytics Debugger

If you‚Äôre using Google Analytics in conjunction with GTM, you can use the **Google Analytics Debugger** extension to verify that your GTM tags are sending the correct data to Analytics.

### Steps to Use Google Analytics Debugger

1. **Install Google Analytics Debugger**: Download the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-debugger/jnkmfdileelhofjcijamephohjechhna).

2. **Activate the Extension**:
   - Once installed, click on the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar to activate it.

3. **Open Developer Tools**:
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or `Cmd + Option + I` on Mac) to open the Chrome Developer Tools.
   - Go to the **Console** tab to see Google Analytics Debugger output.

4. **Review Data**:
   - When you navigate through your site, the Console tab will show all the tracking information being sent to Google Analytics, including events and page views triggered by GTM.

5. **Check for GTM Events**:
   - Look for the **eventCategory**, **eventAction**, and other parameters being passed from your GTM tags. If these are missing or incorrect, you may need to adjust your GTM setup.

## üéØ Best Practices for Testing GTM Tags

- **Test in Incognito Mode**: Sometimes, browser extensions or cached data may interfere with tag firing. Using Incognito mode ensures a fresh environment.
- **Test Across Different Pages**: If your GTM setup applies to multiple pages or actions, be sure to test each one to verify everything works as expected.
- **Use the Right Triggers**: Make sure your triggers are properly configured to fire the tag when the correct conditions are met (e.g., form submission, page load, button click).
